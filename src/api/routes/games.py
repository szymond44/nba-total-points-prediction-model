    - Prints a summary line describing how many seasons will be processed and the range (oldest to newest).
    - Iterates over the seasons using tqdm to display a progress bar.
    - For each season, calls await sync_games(season, db, tqdm_disable=True) to perform the per-season synchronization.

    Notes:
    - This function is an async endpoint/coroutine and must be awaited by the caller or used by an async framework (e.g., FastAPI).
