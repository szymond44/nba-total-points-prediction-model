@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    """
    Asynchronous lifespan context manager for a FastAPI application.
    This async generator performs application startup and shutdown tasks related to
    database lifecycle management.
    Behavior
    - Startup:
        - Prints a startup message to stdout.
        - Opens an asynchronous connection transaction on the global `engine`
            and runs `Base.metadata.create_all` to ensure database tables are created.
    - Yield:
        - Yields control back to FastAPI so the application can run normally after
            initialization is complete.
    - Shutdown:
        - Prints a shutdown message to stdout.
        - Disposes the global `engine` to close any remaining database connections.
    Parameters
    - app (FastAPI): The FastAPI application instance that this lifespan is bound to.
    Yields
    - None: Control is yielded to the FastAPI runtime while the application is running.
    Exceptions
    - Any exception raised during database initialization (create_all) or engine
        disposal will propagate to the FastAPI runtime.
    Notes
    - Assumes `engine` (an SQLAlchemy AsyncEngine) and `Base` (declarative metadata)
        exist in the module scope where this function is defined.
    - Intended to be provided to FastAPI via the `lifespan` parameter:
            app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)
    - Side effects include printing to stdout and creating database tables.

    Return basic service health information.

    Asynchronous health-check endpoint intended for monitoring and readiness/liveness probes.
    This function performs no side effects and returns a minimal payload describing the current

        dict: A dictionary containing:
            - "status" (str): Health status, typically "ok" when the service is operational.
            - "version" (str): The service version (e.g., "0.1.0").
